excerpt: "Elucidating the developmental process of an organism will require the complete cartography of cellular lineages in the spatial, temporal, and molecular domains. We present Zebrahub, a comprehensive dynamic atlas of zebrafish embryonic development that combines single-cell sequencing time course data with light-sheet microscopy-based lineage reconstructions. Zebrahub is a foundational resource to study developmental processes at both transcriptional and spatiotemporal levels. It is publicly accessible as a web-based resource, providing an open- access collection of datasets and tools. Using this resource we shed new light on the pluripotency of Neuro-Mesodermal Progenitors (NMPs). We find that NMPs are pluripotent only during early axis elongation before becoming exclusively mesodermal progenitors. We attribute this restriction in NMP cell fate to emerging morphodynamic features that compartmentalize tissue motion."
